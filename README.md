# 🤖 BrowserAgent2: Web Intelligence and Automated Browser Agent with Gemini & MCP

**BrowserAgent2** is an automated agent that executes user instructions on a Chrome browser using Playwright, orchestrated by a Browser MCP Server (Model Context Protocol, SSE-based) and powered by Gemini for intelligent tool selection and reasoning.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Natural language command execution in a real browser
- Gemini LLM for instruction analysis and tool selection
- Modular MCP server (SSE protocol)
- Multi-turn conversation with context

---

## 📁 Directory Structure
- `main.py` — Main entry point for the agent  
- `browserMCP/browser_mcp_sse.py` — MCP server (must be started separately)  
- `config/` — Configuration files (MCP server, models, profiles)  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies  
- `action/`, `agent/`, `memory/`, etc. — Core modules
